# plbEdit
An experimental PMD 3/4 placement data editor.
  
PlbEdit can edit PLB files (mostly), as well as import/export in JSON/XML formats.  Currently `SplineType`s (the PLB equivalent of SplinePaths in Lua) aren't supported.  Support for PMD 3 (GtI) is not available yet.  A few PLB components aren't supported by the GUI, but are still saved correctly and can be imported/exported.

Some information on the PLB format can be found under `docs`.

More/better information coming Soon&trade;
